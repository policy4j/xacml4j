/**
 * In many applications, policies specify actions that MUST be performed,
 * either instead of, or in addition to, actions that MAY be performed.
 * XACML provides facilities to specify actions that MUST be performed in
 * conjunction with policy evaluation via {@link Obligation}.
 * There are no standard definitions for these actions in version 3.0 of XACML.
 * Therefore, bilateral agreement between a PAP and the PEP that will
 * enforce its policies is required for correct interpretation.
 * PEPs that conform to v3.0 of XACML are required to deny access unless
 * they understand and can discharge all of the {@link Obligation}  associated
 * with the applicable policy.
