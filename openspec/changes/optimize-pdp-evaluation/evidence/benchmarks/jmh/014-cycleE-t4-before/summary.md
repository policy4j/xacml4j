# 014: cycle E with -t 4, before (the cycle D jar; pair with 015)

Session 3, 2026-10-27 08:19 to 08:54 UTC: Oracle GraalVM 25.0.4 with C2 (`-XX:-UseJVMCICompiler`), `-Xms2g -Xmx2g -XX:+UseG1GC`, 3 forks x 5 iterations, `-prof gc`; no agent session of this project alive; load average 7 to 10 on 12 cores from other processes. Jars from frozen tree copies that differ only in the cycle's files (`env.txt` has each jar's sha256). A difference is claimed only when the 99.9% intervals are disjoint.

Four threads share one PDP. Comparison in `015-cycleE-t4-after/summary.md`.
