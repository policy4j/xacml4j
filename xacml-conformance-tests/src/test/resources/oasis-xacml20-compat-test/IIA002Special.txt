Test IIA002 requires the Context Handler to be able to obtain an
Attribute from an external repository, where the required
Attribute is not supplied in the physical request received
from the PEP.

The test as written uses an Attribute with
AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:example:attribute:role",
value "Physician", and Subject named "Julius Hibbert".

This test may be modified to use a different AttributeId and
AttributeValue in the SubjectAttributeDesignator of the
Policy.xml file, and a different Subject in the Request.xml file,
so long as the SubjectAttributeDesignator refers to an attribute
that is not present in the original input Request.xml file.  Any
modified version of the test must still demonstrate that the
Context Handler is able to obtain values for particular
attributes that are referenced in its policies, even if those
attributes are not present in the Request as received from the
PEP.
